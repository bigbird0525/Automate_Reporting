# Automate_Reporting
The purpose of this program is to create a series of web drivers that scrape all of our 3rd party partners' data. It currently
supports LKQD, Vera, and Streamrail platforms. 

There are a couple things that still need work:
1. More robust error handling
2. Figure out why the wait() methods in Selenium don't work as intended sometimes.
